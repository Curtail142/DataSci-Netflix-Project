# This code processes a dataset of Netflix movies to analyze and visualize trends in movie durations over the years. It filters the data to include only movies, selects specific columns of interest, and identifies movies shorter than 60 minutes. It then assigns colors to movies based on their genres ("Children," "Documentaries," and "Stand-Up") and plots a scatter plot of movie durations against their release years, with the assigned colors indicating genres. The visualization helps explore whether movies are becoming shorter over time, though the conclusion remains uncertain, indicated by the variable answer being set to "maybe".
